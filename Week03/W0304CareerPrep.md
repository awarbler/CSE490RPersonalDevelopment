===================================
    -   Identify one to two people who have influenced you the most in your academic or professional career in each of the following categories friends, family, mentors, coaches, researchers, teachers, instructors, or experts in the field)  How did they influence you? 
        -   Friends - My friend Arien encouraged me to go back to school in 2017 when I was going through a divorce. Reminding me that I am capable of achieving obstacles in my life and encouraging me to lean on my Heavenly Father. 
        -   Family - My brother has encouraged me to look into schools for my Master's.  He has been a listening ear with my school struggles and job struggles. He has looked over my resume and has interviewed me several times. 
        -   Teachers - My Discrete Mathematics teacher has helped me this past semester to apply for grad school at The University of Texas in Austin. He looked over the program, and the application and told me what things I needed to work on before I applied. He helped with the application process, along with just being supportive.  He went above and beyond to encourage me to apply. I am grateful for his assistance. 
    -   What new questions (2-3 each) would you ask them before graduating?
        -   Arien: As someone who has been actively involved in my job search and resume reviews, what areas do you think I should focus on for personal and professional growth post-graduation?
        -   Brother: In your opinion, what are the key skills or experiences employers in our field are currently looking for, and how can I align myself with those expectations?
        -   Teacher: As I transition into the next phase of my education or career, are there specific networking or professional development opportunities you would suggest for me?
