# Tasking

For this, you need to identify the customer needs.

- **Step 1:** Meet the customer. Attend the opening meetings with the instructor and customer. Take meeting minutes. Start your own thread in the discussion board, and post your notes, and what you learned.
- **Step 2:** Collect information from the previously worked project. (If this is a new project, you will need to start the requirements elicitation processes mentioned above.) Record what you found and reply to your thread in the discussion board.
- **Step 3:** Determine what area you would like to work on the project. List your talents, skills, and reason why you think you would be a good fit. If you don't think you fit, but really want to learn more about it, indicate that also. Post an elevator speech, as to why you would be good in this role.

The overall tone of the meeting was informative, and Brother Clements aimed to clarify project goals, tasks, and Agile methodologies.

I made a post on Teams because I wasn't sure where we were supposed to post.

# Step 1

## My notes from the meeting:

1. **Distinction between Team Lead and Team Member:** Brother Clements will tell us more at the end. But I must have missed what he said because I don't remember the difference
2. **Agile Methodology Overview:** Brother Clements provided an overview of Agile methodology in software development, tracing its evolution from earlier methodologies like the waterfall model. He highlighted the success of Agile in increasing project success rates.
3. **Agile Principles:** Brother Clements outlined the principles of Agile, emphasizing values such as prioritizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools, delivering working products, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

# Post on Teams

It states to make a discussion board post and I wasn't sure if it was here or on canvas. So I am posting it here.

## Tasking for homework:

Meet the customer. Attend the opening meetings with the instructor and customer. Take meeting minutes. Start your own thread in the discussion board, and post your notes, and what you learned.

During the meeting, Brother Clements discussed various topics related to the upcoming project and Agile methodology. He explained the difference between a Team Lead and a Team Member, and provided an overview of Agile methodology, including its success in increasing project success rates.

## Elevator Speech

"Hello everyone, my name is Anita Woodford, and I am excited to contribute to the Community Board app project. With my background in .Net Software Development, proficiency in multiple programming languages, and coursework in machine learning, I am confident that I can be a versatile contributor to the project. One of my strengths is my passion for documentation. I have previously worked as an editor for Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and other documents, which has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the clarity and precision that well-crafted documentation brings to a project. Even though I have the skills to be a Project Manager, I prefer to focus on development or documentation. However, I am open to the possibility of taking on the role of Project Manager to help ensure the project's success. Thank you for considering my commitment and expertise for a role that aligns with development and effective project communication."
