# Tasking

For this, you need to identify the customer needs.

- **Step 1:** Meet the customer. Attend the opening meetings with the instructor and customer. Take meeting minutes. Start your own thread in the discussion board, and post your notes, and what you learned.
- **Step 2:** Collect information from the previously worked project. (If this is a new project, you will need to start the requirements elicitation processes mentioned above.) Record what you found and reply to your thread in the discussion board.
- **Step 3:** Determine what area you would like to work on the project. List your talents, skills, and reason why you think you would be a good fit. If you don't think you fit, but really want to learn more about it, indicate that also. Post an elevator speech, as to why you would be good in this role.

The overall tone of the meeting was informative, and Brother Clements aimed to clarify project goals, tasks, and Agile methodologies.

I made a post on Teams because I wasn't sure where we were supposed to post.

# Post on Teams

It states to make a discussion board post and I wasn't sure if it was here or on canvas. So I am posting it here.

## Tasking for homework:

**Step 1:**

Meet the customer. Attend the opening meetings with the instructor and customer. Take meeting minutes. Start your own thread in the discussion board, and post your notes, and what you learned.

During the meeting, Brother Clements discussed various topics related to the upcoming project and Agile methodology. He explained the difference between a Team Lead and a Team Member, and provided an overview of Agile methodology, including its success in increasing project success rates. He also outlined the principles of Agile, focusing on values such as prioritizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools, and delivering working products. Additionally, Brother Clements introduced the concept of breaking down tasks into stories and using estimation points to assess the complexity of tasks.

He discussed the project for the upcoming weeks and assigned specific tasks to each team, including solicitation techniques, system requirement specification (SRS), and user documentation. He encouraged teams to break down tasks into stories, create issues in the project management tool, and provide status updates regularly. He also emphasized the importance of milestones, branches, and repositories in tracking project progress, and asked participants to reflect on the customer's perspective and gather feedback.

Brother Clements assigned various assignments related to career preparation, status reports, reflection on customer experience, and completion of specific project-related tasks. He also indicated availability for questions and encouraged participants to communicate through MS Teams. Overall, the meeting aimed to clarify project goals, tasks, and Agile methodologies in an informative and helpful manner.

**Step 2:**

Collect information from the previously worked project. (If this is a new project you will need to start the requirements elicitation processes mentioned above.) Record what you found and reply to your thread in the discussion board. 

Part of this came from Darcy and our team meeting and then I added information from the excel spreadsheet. 

This is what ChatGPT spat out for me once I added all of the other features
it did not turn out like I assumed maybe I didnt asked the question correct. If anyone has any ideas Please add them here

This is what I asked it to do: Create SRS Document template for us to make a Community Board app, which includes what will be in the core app, stretch features, and next features and including sections for Front-End, Back-end, Database/Tables for all three. Please provide content in this as well. Combine all of these notes delete duplicates

## Elevator Speech

"Hello everyone, my name is Anita Woodford, and I am excited to contribute to the Community Board app project. With my background in .Net Software Development, proficiency in multiple programming languages, and coursework in machine learning, I am confident that I can be a versatile contributor to the project. One of my strengths is my passion for documentation. I have previously worked as an editor for Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and other documents, which has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the clarity and precision that well-crafted documentation brings to a project. Even though I have the skills to be a Project Manager, I prefer to focus on development or documentation. However, I am open to the possibility of taking on the role of Project Manager to help ensure the project's success. Thank you for considering my commitment and expertise for a role that aligns with development and effective project communication."
