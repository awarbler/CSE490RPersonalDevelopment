**Situation:**

I was assigned to contribute to the map classification project but needed help understanding where to start. I had yet to set specific goals in previous reflections.

**Task:**

To address this, I added myself to the map classification task. However, my contribution at that point was minimal, and I had yet to provide significant value to the program or team.

**Action:**

Realizing the need to improve, I sent a request to the customer seeking approval for my pull request. I also acknowledged the gaps in my involvement and started looking at the project and requirement list to understand better how I could contribute.

**Result:**

While I had yet to provide much value to the program or team, I identified the areas for improvement. My focus for the next week is to be more involved, address issues with the requirements, and contribute meaningfully to the team and project.

5.     If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?

The Church of Jesus gospel places a strong emphasis on unity, collaboration, and service. Similarly, the work experience shared highlights the value of working together as a team and contributing. This reflects a commitment to a shared goal and the idea that individuals can achieve more when collaborating and supporting one another.

In the gospel teachings, serving others is often emphasized as a way to express love and compassion. Similarly, in the work context, contributing to the team and being actively involved is a form of service to the collective goal of the project or program.
