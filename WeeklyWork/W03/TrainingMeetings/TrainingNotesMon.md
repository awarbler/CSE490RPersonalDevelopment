Here are the training notes from the meeting:

1.  **Differences Between Project and Product Management:**

    -   Project management involves overseeing the entire process of software development, while product management focuses specifically on the development of the product itself.
2.  **Development Environment:**

    -   Determining the type of integrated development environments (IDEs) needed for the project is crucial.
    -   Understanding how to run the software on individual machines for development purposes is essential.
3.  **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:**

    -   MVC architecture consists of three components: model, view, and controller.
    -   The view represents what the user sees in the software interface.
    -   The controller manages the logic and workflows within the software.
    -   The model stores and processes data, interacting with both the view and the controller.
4.  **Workflow and Process Diagrams:**

    -   Workflow and process diagrams help visualize how tasks are performed within the system.
    -   These diagrams illustrate the flow of data and interactions between different components of the software.
5.  **Communication and Collaboration:**

    -   Effective communication and collaboration between teams are essential for successful project development.
    -   Teams should work together to determine the necessary software tools for development.

Overall, the training notes covered important concepts related to project management, development environments, architectural design patterns, and collaboration strategies for project teams. These insights will help guide students in their roles within the project development process.
