Training 1.24.24

Here's a summary of the key points covered in the notes:

1.  **Software Requirement Document (SRS):**

-   An SRS document must be developed by the end of the week, outlining the product, its architectural elements, scenarios, customer needs, and user roles.
-   Requirements in the SRS document are specific and use "shall" to outline what the software should do, focusing on capabilities rather than implementation details.
-   Test methods such as demos, code inspections, and others are used to verify these requirements.

1.  **Project Tasks and Performance:**

-   Interns must provide updates on project tasks, completed stories, performance metrics, and plans.
-   Collaboration within teams is emphasized, with recognition given to team members who assist.

1.  **Preparation Assignments:**

-   Interns must identify mentors, coaches, and professional resources to support their career development.
-   Weekly reflections and answering questions contribute to the overall grade.

1.  **Software Configuration Management:**

-   Repositories for version control are essential to manage changes, prevent accidental deletions, and facilitate collaboration.
-   Branching strategies and merging procedures are crucial for effective collaboration and avoiding conflicts in code changes.

1.  **Development Workflow:**

-   The development workflow involves identifying bugs or deficiencies, documenting requirements or changes, coding, testing, and integrating changes into the software.

1.  **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:**

-   Systems typically follow the MVC architectural pattern, separating components into model, view, and controller layers.
-   MVC architecture facilitates modularity and maintenance of software systems.

1.  **GitHub Training:**

-   GitHub training focused on repositories, branching, merging, and version control.
-   Interns are required to take notes on the GitHub training and provide a summary of what they learned.

The training session covered essential aspects of software development, project management, and collaboration using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
