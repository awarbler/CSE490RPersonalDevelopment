Bi-Weekly Status Report
=======================

Bi-Weekly Status Report        Name:Anita Woodford       Project Title: Community Board  Score:100

Each week you submit a status report to indicate the progress you're making and list your goals for the upcoming week. Students working in teams must individually submit these status reports to discuss their specific contributions and plans.

The purpose of this report is to help you gauge your own progress and to help the instructor in mentoring.

For status reports, create a template text file with the following sections:
