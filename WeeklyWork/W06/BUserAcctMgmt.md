# Backend Functionalities for User Account Management

The backend system must support a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage user accounts effectively. Here's a detailed list of the required functionalities:

## 1. User Registration
- **Endpoint for Account Creation**: A secure API endpoint to register new users. It should collect essential information like username, email, and password.
- **Email Verification**: After registration, send a verification email to the user to validate their email address, enhancing account security.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all user input is validated for format and uniqueness (e.g., email and username) to prevent invalid data entry.

## 2. Login
- **Authentication Endpoint**: A secure login API that authenticates users based on their credentials (username/email and password).
- **Session Management**: Create and manage user sessions, providing a token (e.g., JWT) for accessing authorized endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting on Login Attempts**: To prevent brute force attacks, implement rate limiting on login attempts from the same IP address.

## 3. Profile Editing
- **Profile Update Endpoint**: Allow users to update their profile information, including personal details like name, contact information, and profile pictures.
- **Password Change Functionality**: Securely enable users to change their passwords, including current password verification and strong password enforcement.
- **Data Validation**: Validate changes to ensure that email addresses, if editable, remain unique and personal information adheres to format requirements.

## 4. Account Deletion
- **Deletion Endpoint**: Provide a secure method for users to delete their accounts, requiring re-authentication or password confirmation to prevent unauthorized deletions.
- **Data Handling**: Define how the user's data is handled post-deletion, ensuring compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR). This may involve permanently removing user data or anonymizing it for record-keeping.

## Security and Compliance
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, especially passwords, must be encrypted using robust algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all API endpoints use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations to protect user information and rights.

Implementing these backend functionalities provides a solid foundation for user account management, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
