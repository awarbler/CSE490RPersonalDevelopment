1.  **20 pts each: Cognitive: (Wow, I learn?... Ok that is deep!)** 100 
    1.  How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?
        1.  My experience in this project has several connections to my past experiences. Firstly, the skills and techniques that I have acquired during this project, such as effective communication, problem-solving, and time management, can be transferred to other projects and contexts. Secondly, collaborating with my team members and engaging with stakeholders in this project is similar to my experiences in other collaborative settings, whether it be academic, professional, or personal projects. Thirdly, improving my technical skills, such as using GitHub, conducting SWOT analyses, or creating software requirements specifications, has enhanced my overall proficiency and versatility in various domains. Lastly, the learning process, which involves seeking feedback, adapting to challenges, and continuously improving, is consistent across different experiences and endeavors. Overall, each experience adds to and enriches my overall skill set and understanding, contributing to my growth and development in various areas of my life.
    2.  How does your experience relate to other classmates' experiences?
        1.  Classmates may face common challenges like technical hurdles, time management, collaborative work, learning styles, and support systems. Sharing experiences and insights, offering encouragement, assistance, and resources to struggling classmates can help overcome these challenges more efficiently. By empathizing with and supporting each other, we can foster a supportive learning environment for everyone.
    3.  Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn't know before?
        1.  I recently helped a classmate to become more familiar with the use of GitHub for project management and collaboration. During our discussion, I showed them how to use certain features of GitHub such as setting up epics, closing issues, and using labels. With this knowledge, they were able to better organize and prioritize project tasks, track completed work, and categorize and filter issues. By utilizing these functionalities, they were able to streamline workflows, track progress more effectively, and collaborate more efficiently with team members. This newfound knowledge enabled them to contribute more effectively to the project and utilize GitHub as a valuable tool for project management and collaboration.
    4.  If you were to write your experience as STAR story, how would you phrase it?
        1.  Situation: During a project collaboration session, I noticed some team members struggled to use GitHub effectively for project management.
        Task: Recognizing the opportunity to assist my peers, I offered to guide GitHub features such as setting epics, closing issues, and applying labels to enhance project organization and collaboration.
        Action: I engaged with my classmates individually, demonstrating how to navigate GitHub's interface and utilize key features step-by-step. I explained the purpose and functionality of epics, guided them through the process of closing issues, and demonstrated how to apply relevant labels to different tasks.
        Result: As a result of my assistance, my classmates better understood GitHub's capabilities and how to leverage them for efficient project management. They were able to organize tasks more effectively, track progress with greater clarity, and collaborate more seamlessly with team members. This increased their confidence in using GitHub as a valuable tool for project collaboration, ultimately contributing to improved project outcomes.
    5.  If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?
        1.  Relating this week's topic to the gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) involves identifying principles that align with LDS teachings and values. Here's a perspective:

        -   Principles of Service and Unity: In the LDS Church, service and unity are central principles taught by Jesus Christ. Just as I offered assistance to my classmates in understanding GitHub, members of the LDS Church are encouraged to serve each other and work together in unity. This aligns with the Savior's teachings to love and support one another, bearing one another's burdens.

        - Strengthening Others: When I shared my knowledge of GitHub with my classmates, my goal was to strengthen and uplift them. Similarly, the LDS Church encourages individuals to share their talents and knowledge to lift others. This is reflected in the Church's emphasis on ministering, where members strive to support and strengthen each other spiritually and temporally.

        -   Learning and Growth: Both in academia and the LDS Church, there is a focus on continual learning and growth. Just as I learned new skills and knowledge about GitHub, members of the LDS Church seek to increase their understanding of gospel principles and deepen their relationship with God through study, prayer, and personal revelation.

        -   Teamwork and Collaboration: Working together harmoniously, as exemplified in the collaboration within a project team, mirrors the LDS Church's emphasis on teamwork and collaboration in accomplishing its mission. Members are encouraged to work together in various callings and assignments, recognizing that unity and cooperation lead to tremendous success and progress.

        -   Overall, by applying principles of service, unity, learning, and collaboration in academic and religious contexts, individuals can strengthen themselves and others, ultimately drawing closer to God and fulfilling their purposes in life.

Note: A SMART goal is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time bound. When writing a SMART goal, you must identify each letter as an outline or use the letters.

Note: A STAR story is used in interviewing candidates, much like a SMART goal, each letter stands for Situation, Tasking, Achievement, and Results. Here are some links about STAR and how to use it.
