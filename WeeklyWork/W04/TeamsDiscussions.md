No Question here just things that I have learned this week working with GitHubs Projects and repository 
 

Lessons learned this week while working with projects and issues in a GitHub repository in Visual Studio. 

	
Use Branches for Development: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This keeps the main branch (usually main or master) clean and allows for more accessible review and merging.
	
Follow a Consistent Branch Naming Convention: Use a consistent naming convention for branches, such as feature/branch-name or bugfix/branch-name, to quickly identify the purpose of each branch.
	
		
Such as W04Awarbler instead of warbler awarb. If handled this way, there will not be additional notes added to the Week04 branch, such as week04-awarbler - #34 
	
	
Keep Commits Atomic and Descriptive: Make sure each commit addresses a specific change. Write clear and descriptive commit messages explaining the change's purpose, even if I am addressing an issue #. It will make it easier than only seeing the issue # when we are viewing. 
	
Regularly Pull Updates from all branches: Keep your local repository up-to-date by regularly pulling updates. This helps prevent merge conflicts and ensures you work with the latest codebase.
	
Link Pull Requests to Issues: If your changes address a specific issue or feature request, link the pull request to the corresponding issue. This helps track progress and provides context for the changes being made. It is essential to add closed if the issue is closed.
	
Close Issues When Completed: Once a pull request is merged, close the associated issue(s) if they have been resolved. This helps keep the project's issue tracker organized and up-to-date.
	
Use Labels and Milestones: Utilize GitHub's labels and milestones to categorize and prioritize issues. This makes tracking progress, identifying high-priority tasks, and assigning work to team members easier.
	
Communicate and Collaborate: Foster open communication within your team by discussing ideas, sharing updates, and asking for help when needed. GitHub's built-in features, such as comments and discussions on pull requests and issues, make collaboration easy and efficient.
